# Mr.Dividend-Income-Calculator
Dividend Income Calculator helps calculate the amount of dividend you will recieve based on dividend yield % and the amount of shares you own. Helpful for speedy calculations when you are trying to add a new position in the market and quickly want to check how much income will this postion add to your monthly, quarterly or monthly income. I personally find it very useful to calculate dividends for fractional shares that I am adding to a ETF like portfolio I am building.
